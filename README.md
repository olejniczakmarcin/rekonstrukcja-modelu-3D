  <li>The project is implemented in c++ and python. </li>
  <li>The algorithm on the basis of a series of photographs registered from different camera settings for any object performs a reconstruction of a three-dimensional model on the basis of the captured photographs./li>
  <li>In order to generate a three-dimensional model of an object from photographs, the algorithm performs the following steps:</li>
  <li>- determination of internal and external parameters of the camera</li>
  <li>- depth map estimation</li>
  <li>- determination of the point cloud</li>
  <li>- generation of a triangular grid</li>
  <li>- smoothing of the triangular grid</li>
  <li>- overlay of two-dimensional graphics on three-dimensional models</li>
</ul>

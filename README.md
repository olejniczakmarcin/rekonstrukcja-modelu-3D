  <li>As part of the thesis, a method of creating three-dimensional models based on
the reconstruction of a three-dimensional scene from a set of images was developed.
This method requires only an image recording device, a series of images of any object
and appropriate computer software. As a result of image analysis, individual fragments
of the images are compared with each other in order to simultaneously determine the
position of points in the scene and the position of cameras recording the images. After
determining the initial dimensions of the scanned objects, the depth estimation
technique is used to finally determine three-dimensional models. The final step is to
analyse the image in order to provide information about the colour of the object and to
create a texture superimposed on the created three-dimensional model of the scanned
    object.</li>

  <li>triangleMesh</li>
  <li>The algorithm was developed using the Open3D library which is presented in the link: http://www.open3d.org/</li>
  <li>The algorithm generates a triangular grid according to the "Alpha Shape" method on the basis of a designated point cloud.</li>
  <li>In the next stage, the generated grid is smoothed in order to get rid of the imperfections from the structure of the generated grid.</li>

  <li>The algorithm implemented using the PCL library https://pointclouds.org/ </li>
  <li>"algorytm wyswietlania chmury punktow"</li>
  <li>The algorithm reads a point cloud with XYZ coordinates and additionally each point of the cloud is assigned information about its colour represented by RGB coordinates.</li> 
  <li>The data set read in this way is displayed in a window with the possibility of omnidirectional model representation.</li>

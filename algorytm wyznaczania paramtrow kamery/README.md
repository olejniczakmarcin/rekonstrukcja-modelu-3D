  <li>The algorithm implemented using the OPENCV library https://opencv.org/</li>
  <li>An algorithm from a series of input photos of a chessboard image taken under different camera settings determines</li>
  <li>the position of the corners of squares in the images and the corresponding coordinates in the image.</li>
  <li>At a further stage, on this basis, a camera parameter matrix is built.</li>

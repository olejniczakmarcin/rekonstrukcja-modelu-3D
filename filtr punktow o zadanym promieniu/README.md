<ul>
  <li>method developed using the point cloud library https://pointclouds.org/ </li>
  <li>The method within the point under consideration forms a circle with a user-defined radius.</li>
  <li>The second parameter set by the user is the number of adjacent points within the created circle.</li>
  <li>If in a given circle the number of adjacent points is smaller than the user's preset number, such a point is deleted, otherwise</li>
  <li>the point remains and the next point is analysed.</li>

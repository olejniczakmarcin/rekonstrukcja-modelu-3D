  <li>The algorithm imposes two-dimensional graphics on three-dimensional models.
  <li>The method consists in assigning a corresponding fragment to each polygon created graphics from the collection of photos of the modeled object.</li> 
  <li>Then, fragments of the graphics are added to the texture atlas and information about the position of the relevant fragments in the texture atlas is added to the grid.</li>
